| Branch                                                     | Tag releases | Laravel version  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| [v1.0](https://github.com/JackieDo/Laravel-Cart/tree/v1.0) | 1.*          | 4.x only         |
| [v2.0](https://github.com/JackieDo/Laravel-Cart/tree/v2.0) | 2.*          | 5.x only         |
