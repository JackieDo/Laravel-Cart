Laravel Cart is a package used to create and manage carts (such as shopping, recently viewed, compared items...) in Laravel application.

# Versions and compatibility
Currently, the Laravel Cart has three branches that are compatible with the following versions of Laravel:

| Branch                                                     | Tag releases | Laravel version  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| [v1.0](https://github.com/JackieDo/Laravel-Cart/tree/v1.0) | 1.*          | 4.x only         |
| [v2.0](https://github.com/JackieDo/Laravel-Cart/tree/v2.0) | 2.*          | 5.x only         |
| [v3.0](https://github.com/JackieDo/Laravel-Cart/tree/v3.0) | 3.*          | 5.x or above     |

# Important note (*)
Version 3.0 has a different structure and working method from previous versions. Therefore, if you have used previous versions and do not want to change or want to learn new ways of working, I recommend that you do not install this version. Staying with the old version, it doesn't give you any new features, but gives you safety.

On the contrary, if you choose version 3.0 to work, you will own particularly useful features that previous versions did not have. It is important that you read the documentation carefully to work properly.
