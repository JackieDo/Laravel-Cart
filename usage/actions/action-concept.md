# Action concept
Actions help us to change the money amounts of the cart such as discounts, taxes, shipping costs...

### Which instance can apply action?
Actions can be applied to items or carts. But only if those items belongs to a commercial cart or those carts are commercial carts.

### Are actions taxable?
You have the right to decide whether actions are taxed or not. And obviously the tax calculation only works if you activate the built-in taxing system of this package. If you do not activate this taxing system, the tax calculation is your job.

### Can multiple actions be applied to an instance?
Yes, sure.

When applying multiple actions to an instance, actions may or may not influence each other, the decision is up to you.
